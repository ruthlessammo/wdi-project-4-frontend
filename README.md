###Overview

The aim of the project was build RESTful application of our choosing with a Ruby on Rails backend and an AngularJS frontend. I chose to build a community based music curation platform, with the ability to rank songs and user profiles based on the perception of other users. The main features of the project were that it had to be user authenticated, have secure routes, and a user could create, edit and delete their profile. The user and tracks (music) model had a many to many relationship for the likes functionality. There was also a comment model built for the feature of leaving feedback on tracks that other users had posted. The last feature was that when a song was liked there would be a ranking system for the songs on a leaderboard. These like would then be turned into a score for the user that posted it. This score would then determine the rankings of the users.


###Technology used

* Ruby on Rails
* AngularJS
* HTML5
* SCSS
* heroku
* API
* git

###Evaluation

In evaluation of the project. It was liberating to have complete free reign over the direction and idea of the project. Although this sometimes meant that one had to be conscious of where the project was at all time and had to be rigorous in hitting deadline. Pair coding in a project like this could have been hugely beneficial as when running in to obstacles they often took longer to deal with than when working in a group. But overall a great experience building a full scale application from the ground up using two separate languages, to then be presented with a good long and well functioning product.   


###Process

The process of the project was easily based on my love for music, and not only for the music but for the love for finding new, exciting, and good quality music. To start SoundCloud was the first port of call. Gaining access to their API was harder than expected as they took a long time to respond and with the scale of the project only being a week long, this meant that the use of their API had to be abandoned. From here it was looking at embedding the actual players for the music to be rendered on the paged with in the end worked well. Adding the users with all their functionality was then all in logical order for completing the rest of the project.

###Challenges
* The challenges for this was time management and scalability of the project due to coming from the team projects. This meant the scope had to be a certain size in order for the project to run smoothly. Other challenges faced were to do with embedding the SoundCloud player, as the source was not trusted so I had to manually ensure that it was in fact a trusted source. There was also issues with the commenting feature and these comments posting the the wrong part of the site.

###What Next?

* Next would be to actually obtain the SoundCloud API and then to experiment with that to see what else could be achieved. Adding tags to a song/track would have been added next if the time had allowed it. This would be be part of a search feature that would allow users to search by name, artist, and tag, adding to the overall user experience.
* These perhaps will be added in version 2.
